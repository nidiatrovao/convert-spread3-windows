## Convert SpreaD3 files on Windows

Based on the \*unix [workaround](https://github.com/VirologyCharite/convert-spread3) for the [SpreaD3](https://rega.kuleuven.be/cev/ecv/software/SpreaD3) [CORS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-origin_resource_sharing) issue, I created an equivalent solution for us Windows users.

## Usage

The script will produce two new files, `index-new.html` and
`main-new.js`. Open the former with your browser. The broken old files are
removed during the script process to avoid any confusion.

This is specific for the last know version of SpreaD3 `v0.9.7.1rc`.
